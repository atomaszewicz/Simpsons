# The Simpsons

As The Simpsons embark's on it's 29th season in a month's time (a seaons during which it will surpass Gun Smoke's record-holding 635 episodes) I took the opportunity to look at how the quality (or at least the IMDb score) has evolved throughout the show's nearly three decade run. 

## Voting

Before we get into how the show is rated, I think it is important to understand who is voting for the IMDb ratings.

First the voting on the series as a whole. [On IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096697/ratings?ref_=tt_ov_rt_) The Simpsons gets an 8.8/10. It is mostly voted on by males, who account for 80% of the votes. 30-45 year-old males seem to like the show the best, rating it 8.9/10. Those under 18 make up less than half a percent of the total votes, though they still rate it quite highly 8.7. The group that gives the show the lowest rating is women 45 years and older, who give it a 7.9/10.

Now the voting by episode. We notice a clear downward trend, which amounts to the show losing 2 votes every episode. This is likely a result of the [show's decreasing audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#Reception_and_achievements), but probably also a factor of the show's nearly 30-year run meaning the early episodes have been replayed more (and thus have been seen and voted-on more).

## Scoring

The average episode score on IMDb is 7.4 with a standard deviation of 0.75. This contrasts with the 8.8/10 rating for the series overall (which slots it as the 54th highest rated show on IMDb). Seeing as the opinion of an average episode is significantly lower than of the series overall, we get our first hint that the show's quality hasn't been consistant. As most Simpsons fans will tell you, the show's quality has ebbed and flowed over the years, so let's see if the IMDb scores reflect this. 

![ep_rate_plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomaszewicz/Simpsons/master/RStudio/Plots/ep_rate_plot.png?raw=TRUE)

Early growth, a peak, a drop, and a plateau: the IMDb ratings mimic the decline in viewers seen above. This shape helps explain why so few under 18 have watched the show: when they were old enough for the program, it has been of quite low quality. But when was it it's best? Searching Google one can find endless pages of "Top X Best/Worst Simpsons Episodes", so let's settle it the best way we know how, by the numbers.

We see that the most highly-rated episode is the episode ["Homer's Enemey"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Homer%27s_Enemy), which is about an outsider pointing out the absurdities in the show's premise. It serves as a nod of self-awarness to the audience as well as a reminder to it's [obsessive fans](https://deadhomersociety.com/2010/08/02/animation-showcase-homer-goes-toÂ college/) that it's just a show. This episode would not make my top 10, but fans evidently like the show taking a break from wacky adventures and looking inwards. Other episodes with ratings above 9.0 include ["You Only Move Twice"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/You_Only_Move_Twice) where Homer is unknowingly hired by a Bond Villain, ["Treehouse of Horror V"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_V) the fifth Halloween special, and ["Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part One"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Who_Shot_Mr._Burns%3F_(Part_One)) a murder mystery where everyone in town is a suspect. We note that all these episodes are between seasons 5 through 9, and that they all have a zscore of over 2.

On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest-rated episode is the Season 23 ["Lisa Goes Gaga"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Goes_Gaga) with a 4.3/10, which features Lady Gaga helping Lisa with her self esteem. Other low-rated episodes include ["All Singing All Dancing"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/All_Singing,_All_Dancing) a musical episode, and an episode where [Moe's washrag tells it's life's story](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moe_Goes_from_Rags_to_Riches). These episodes have a zscore in the range of -2 to -4.

We note that the zscores for the worst episodes are larger (in magnitude) than the best episodes. With 600+ episodes you're bound to have a few stinkers; what I'm trying to study here is less a few crummy scripts, but more how the show has evolved. One of the most pieces of the show's evolution is the peak, also known as "The Golden Age".


## Golden Years

The exact beginning and ending of the "Golden Age" is a hotly debated topic amongst fans, but the general concensus is that it starts around season 2 or 3 and ends around season 11 or 12 ([here is one artist's opinion](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Simpsons/blob/master/RStudio/Plots/1467480120160.jpg)). To quantify the period we can look at the IMDb scores and find the max the peak but how do quantify when it started and when it ends? Let's start by looking at the average score for each season.

![avg_rate_plot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/atomaszewicz/Simpsons/master/RStudio/Plots/avg_rating_plot.png?raw=TRUE)

Seasons 2-8 have an average rating of above 8.0, season 1 & 9-16 averages are above 7.0, and seasons 17-28 are in the range 6.5-7.0. Since I like whole numbers I'll choose to cut off the "Golden Age" at an average score of 8.0. So we're left with seasons 2-8 being the show at it's peak. 

These 6 seasons is when then show was in peak form, still finding it's footing before, and the show losing it's edge after. But how does quality fluctuate during this "Golden Age"?

![gold_rate1](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Simpsons/blob/master/RStudio/Plots/gold_rate1.png?raw=TRUE)

The trend curve shows that the IMDb score doesn't fluctuate that much during the 6 golden seasons. A curve fitted to the ratings fluctuates little over the period. The difference between the max and min of the regression is less than 2/5 of a point (with a linear fit this difference shrinks to 0.07 points). Lastly, the average "Golden Age" episode rating is 8.2, which has a zscore just above 1 compared to the series average of 7.4. So it seems the "Golden Age" is real, the show did have 6 seasons where the episodes were fairly consistent in quality. 

## Treehouse of Horror

On the topic of higher-than-average quality, The Simpson's annual "Treehouse of Horror" (ToH) episodes are some of my personal favorite episodes, and with Halloween only a couple weeks away, what better time to find out if these episodes are truly great, or i'm clouded by the fun of the spooky atmosphere.

For the past 27 Halloweens The Simpsons has aired a triplet of shorts that pay homage to, or parody, films, television shows, comics, and of course episodes of [The Twilight Zone](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFokFDyDGgs). These episodes allow the writers to break the show's [canon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canon_(fiction)) and write the characters in fantastic situations. 

As we saw earlier "Treehouse of Horror V", which is rated 9.1, is one of the series highest scoring episodes, while the worst ToH episode, and the only installment with a score lower than the season's average, is the 22nd installment of the Halloween special, which scores 6.6, with a zscore of -1 for the series, and -0.2 for that season.  

Though all but one ToH episodes score above average, they don't score that far above the mean. The ToH episodes average score is 7.6 compared with the series 7.4. Even during the "Golden Age" the ToH shows stand out, averaging 8.5 compared with the overall 6-season average of 8.2.

![treehouse_boxplot](https://github.com/atomaszewicz/Simpsons/blob/master/RStudio/Plots/treehouse_boxplot.png?raw=true)

There are 9 seasons in which the Treehouse of Horror is the highest-rated episode, and 2 that fall at or below the median. So these are certainly above-average episodes, but rating-wise they are not only noticeably higher higher (7.6 compared to series-mean of 7.4). This makes sense in hindsight, as they are still a product of the season's staff, and likely don't get *that* much more attention than other episodes. 

## Conclusion

The Simpsons exploded onto TV's in the late 90's, where it stirred up as much fandom as it did controversy. 28 seasons later it's format and style has been copied so many times it's hard to appreciate how cutting-edge it was when it premiered. In fact the show is now such a staple of our culture that "The Simpsons did it" is a culture phenomon [pointed out by the show South Park](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpsons_Already_Did_It) where writers subconciously copy plot elements from the show and where social media pages posting 20 year-old [screenshots](https://www.instagram.com/thesimpsonsig/) or [quotes](https://twitter.com/SimpsonsQOTD) have hundreds of thousands of followers.

The show has gone through hundreds of writers, animators, show runners, and directors, many of whom have gone on to have great careers (including everyone's favorite [orange-haired late night host](http://1075koolfm.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Conan-1.jpg)). This comes at a cost since being such a strong breeding ground for young talent has not afforded long-term staff, and losing a large portion of your staff every year certainly doesn't help stability. While obviously constantly losing your best talent doesn't make keeping your show new and original very easy, I don't think that is the main reason behind the show's decline. 

In my mind The Simpsons was so ground-breaking that it couldn't possibly have stayed that way forever. It was such a popular and influential show that eventually the landscape of television would be just as foul and vulgar. On top of that, with 600+ scripts in it's wake, it is understandably difficult to create fresh and new ideas with the same old characters. 

However much the quality has dropped and however few fans that remain, it's hard to imagine a day where The Simpsons is taken off the air. A lot of fans complain that it shld've been axed a long time ago, but I think they'll all shed a tear when soon the world's longest running show has it's curtain call. Then again, they may never [stop the simpsons](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZYNwzeqVUA).
