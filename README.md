# The Simpsons

As The Simpsons embark's on it's 29th season in a month's time (a seaons during which it will surpass Gun Smoke's record-holding 635 episodes) I took the opportunity to look at how the quality (or at least, the IMDb score) has evolved throughout it's nearly three decade run. I plan to eventually analyze the Nielsen television ratings too, but I will prioritize the IMDb ratings.
