# The Simpsons

As The Simpsons embark's on it's 29th season in a month's time (a seaons during which it will surpass Gun Smoke's record-holding 635 episodes) I took the opportunity to look at how the quality (or at least the IMDb score) has evolved throughout the show's nearly three decade run. 

## Voting

Over 80% of the votes are from Males, with the Male 18-29 and 30-45 year old demographics alone making up almost two thirds of the total votes, while combined Male & Female under 18 demo makes up less than half a percant of the votes (we wil see later that this group discovered the show after it's decline in quality). Men rate the series 8.8/10 while Women rate it 8.6/10. 30-44 years old men give the series a 9.1, the highest rating among all demographics, while Women 45+ give it the lowest rating, a 7.9/10.

We notice a clear downward trend, which amounts to the show losing 2 votes every episode. This is likely a result of the [show's decreasing audience](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Simpsons#Reception_and_achievements), but probably also a factor of the show's nearly 30-year run meaning the early episodes have been replayed more (and thus have been seen and voted-on more) than recent ones.

## Scoring

The average episode score is 7.4 with a standard deviation of 0.75. This contrasts with the 8.8/10 overall, which makes it the 54th highest rated show on IMDb. Seeing as the opinion of an average episode is significantly lower than of the series overall, we get our first hint that the show's quality hasn't been consistant. As most Simpsons fans will tell you, the show's quality has ebbed and flowed over the years, so let's see if the IMDb scores reflect this.

Early growth, a peak, a drop, and a plateau. The early episodes hover mostly between 7.5-9, while the later episodes sit in the 6.5-7.5 range. So the IMDb ratings do reflect this 'decline' is real (this is the point where Simpsons fans DM me saying "DUH!"). There are a few distinct regions to this plot, most importantly the peak aka the "Golden Age" (we will come back to this later). First we want to look at the highest highs, and the lowest lows.

With a quick Google search, one can find endless pages of "Top X Best/Worst Simpsons Episodes", so let's settle it the best way we know how, by the numbers.

Oddly enough we see that the most highly-rated episode is the episode ["Homer's Enemey"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Homer%27s_Enemy), the premise of which is an outsider pointing out the absurdities in the show's premise. It serves as a nod of self-awarness to the audience as well as a reminder to it's [obsessive fans](https://deadhomersociety.com/2010/08/02/animation-showcase-homer-goes-toÂ college/) that it's just a show. This episode would not make my top 10, but fans evidently like the show taking a break from wacky adventures and looking inwards.

Other episodes with ratings above 9.0 include ["You Only Move Twice"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/You_Only_Move_Twice) where Homer is unknowingly hired by a Bond Villain, ["Cape Feare"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Cape_Feare) a remake of the 1962 film ["Cape Fear"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Fear_(1962_film)) where The Simpsons enter a witness protection program after Bart receives death threats from his nemsis Sideshow Bob, ["Treehouse of Horror V"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Treehouse_of_Horror_V) one of the classic Halloween episodes (which features homages to ["The Shining"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shining_(film)) and ["Soylent Green"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Sound_of_Thunder)), and ["Who Shot Mr. Burns? Part One"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Who_Shot_Mr._Burns%3F_(Part_One)) a murder mystery where everyone in town is a suspect. We note that all these episodes are between seasons 5 through 9, and that they all have a zscore of over 2 (with respect to the series average).

On the other end of the spectrum, the lowest-rated episode is the Season 23 ["Lisa Goes Gaga"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Lisa_Goes_Gaga) with a 4.3/10, which features Lady Gaga helping Lisa with her self esteem. Other low-rated episodes include ["All Singing All Dancing"](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/All_Singing,_All_Dancing) a musical episode, an episode where [The Simpsons go to Jerusalem](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/The_Greatest_Story_Ever_D%27ohed) and Homer defiles various holy sites, and an episode where [Moe's washrag tells it's life's story](http://simpsons.wikia.com/wiki/Moe_Goes_from_Rags_to_Riches). These episodes have a zscore in the range of -2 to -4 (with respect to the series average & variance). 

We note that the zscores for the worst episodes are larger (in magnitude) than the best episodes. With 600+ episodes you're bound to have a few stinkers; what I'm trying to study here is less a few crummy scripts, but more how the show has evolved. A good place to start is at the show's peak, often refered to as the "Golden Age".
