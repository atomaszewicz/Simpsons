# The Simpsons

As The Simpsons embark's on it's 29th season in a month's time (a seaons during which it will surpass Gun Smoke's record-holding 635 episodes) I took the opportunity to look at how the quality (or at least the IMDb score) has evolved throughout the show's nearly three decade run. 

## Voting

Over 80% of the votes are from Males, with the Male 18-29 and 30-45 year old demographics alone making up almost two thirds of the total votes, while combined Male & Female under 18 demo makes up less than half a percant of the votes (we wil see later that this group discovered the show after it's decline in quality). Men rate the series 8.8/10 while Women rate it 8.6/10. 30-44 years old men give the series a 9.1, the highest rating among all demographics, while Women 45+ give it the lowest rating, a 7.9/10.
